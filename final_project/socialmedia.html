            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm an advertising and public relations student studying at UNL. I have always had a love for being creative. I hope to be on the creative side of advertising. Take a look around to learn more about me!</p>
            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <p>This semester I am taking ADPR 485, ADPR 323, COMM 374, PHIL 105, and PSYC 288.</p>
            <h2>Outside of Class</h2>
            <p>I enjoy cooking, baking, painting, ceramics, traveling, music, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
            <h2>After Graduation</h2>
            <p>I would like to go into the creative side of Advertising after graduations. I enjoy working with clients and creating what they may not be able to. With my major in ADPR and minors in psychology and communications I hope to be successful in whatever I end up doing. I hope to land in the KC area but am open to other places.</p>
